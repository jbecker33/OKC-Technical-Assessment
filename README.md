# OKC-Technical-Assessment

****About this repo****

This repository is my technical assesment for the Oklahoma City Thunder Data Analyst Intern position.  The code was written in R.

The repository consists of a .rmd file which is my code written in R to answer the technical assesment questions.  Code is broken up into each question.

Additionally, to run this file the shots_data.csv, which is not included in this repository, needs to be in the same working directory as the .rmd file.

****Running this Code****

To run this code change the working directory on line 9 to your respective working directory with the .rmd file and the included shots_data.csv in the same file.
